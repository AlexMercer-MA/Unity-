Unity多平台输入共用一份代码的时候，可以加#if进行区分
如果#if #endif之间的代码变为灰色，说明当前所选择的build平台不符合这个if语句中指定的平台类型

例子：
#if UNITY_IOS || UNITY_ANDROID
touch code
#else
non-touch code
#endif

区分不同运行平台
UNITY_EDITOR	#define directive for calling Unity Editor scripts from your game code.
UNITY_EDITOR_WIN	#define directive for Editor code on Windows.
UNITY_EDITOR_OSX	#define directive for Editor code on Mac OS X.

UNITY_STANDALONE	#define directive for compiling/executing code for any standalone platform (Mac OS X, Windows or Linux).
UNITY_STANDALONE_WIN	#define directive for compiling/executing code specifically for Windows standalone applications.
UNITY_STANDALONE_OSX	#define directive for compiling/executing code specifically for Mac OS X (including Universal, PPC and Intel architectures).

UNITY_IOS	#define directive for compiling/executing code for the iOS platform.
UNITY_IPHONE	Deprecated. Use UNITY_IOS instead.
UNITY_ANDROID	#define directive for the Android platform.

UNITY_PS4	#define directive for running PlayStation 4 code.
UNITY_XBOXONE	#define directive for executing Xbox One code.
UNITY_WEBGL	#define directive for WebGL.
UNITY_FACEBOOK	#define directive for the Facebook platform (WebGL or Windows standalone).
UNITY_ADS	#define directive for calling Unity Ads methods from your game code. Version 5.2 and above.

区分不同Unity版本
UNITY_5	#define directive for the release version of Unity 5, exposed in every 5.X.Y release.
UNITY_5_0	#define directive for the major version of Unity 5.0, exposed in every 5.0.Z release.
UNITY_5_0_1	#define directive for the minor version of Unity 5.0.1.
Starting from Unity 5.3.4, you can compile code selectively based on the earliest version of Unity required to compile or execute a given portion of code. Given the same version format as above (X.Y.Z), Unity exposes one global #define in the format UNITY_X_Y_OR_NEWER, that can be used for this purpose.
